# Interactive_card

## Goals

- This is a challenge provided by frontendmentor.io. I wanted to do this becuase I presents a straightforward way to provide value to a company by creating an interactive credit card.
- It also allows me to get some extra practice with form fields and explore a couple new challenges.

## Notes

- Learned a neat new trick to have a div's background image auto adjust to it's the same as the background image size.
- Learned that maxLength attribute doesn't work with "number" type for inputs.
